    <main>
        <p>We ski and snowboard at resorts when the snow falls expecting that because the rope has dropped and patrol have opened a slope that it's safe. Except it's not always and we believe that wearing a beacon can help with the worst happens.</p>

        <p>A beacon can't stop an avalanche but it can help with precious minutes during a rescue situation. It's really not that hard just throw your beacon on when you getting your boots on, leave it running when you are out shredding.</p>

        <h2>The ways to help</h2>
        
        <h3>Everyone</h3>
        <p>When you ski on a powder day at a resort please wear a beacon, talk to your friends and family about the advantages of wearing a beacon and know how to use it.</p>

        <p>Post to social media and group chat's #beaconsinbounds, get the word out and keep the conversation going.</p>

        <p>Make this your own, we started this and really don't care about owning it we just want people to stay safe and keep you safe.</p>

        <h3>Those with a story to tell</h3>

        <h5>You</h5>
        <p>This is about all of us</p>

        <h5>Riley Bathurst</h5>
        <p>I started this idea, growing up in New Zealand I spent time snowboarding at the tiny club fields where safety is really your own responsibility, after spending more time at commercial fields again I found the safety of my friends to be more relaxed and this seemed like a nice little hashtag.</p>
